- Each option in the prompt corresponds to a different action.
- Selecting the "Queries" option will open another prompt where you can choose which query to execute out of five options.
- If you select the "recordUpdate" option, you will be prompted to choose a record using its primary key, and then update the record's fields by typing column names and new values as comma-separated inputs (e.g., "<col1 name>,<new val1>,<col2 name>,<new val2>..."). If you need to update a field that involves time, enter the date and time in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". To update any date fields, enter data in this format "MM/DD/YY".
